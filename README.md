# sql-library-manager
 My eighth Treehouse project: An application to manage a library collection created using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite, and the SQL ORM Sequelize. HTML design, initial CSS, and an existing SQLite database were provided by Treehouse. The purpose of this project is to learn how to implement and utilize a database for data persistence and CRUD interactions. I'm going for an Exceeds Expectations grade, so this project will also include a search option and pagination.
